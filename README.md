# xvapi

## This is unofficial valorant api wrapper with a gui implementation (couldn't find better words [pls help me])

#

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/TheXlebushek/xvapi
$ cd xvapi
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

Then you can find a working instance of app at [localhost:5555](localhost:5555)

It is recommended to use [pm2](https://pm2.io/) if you want to scale the app

No more docks for now, check for updates later
